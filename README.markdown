## Update 2012-02-21
PHPUnit Installer now supports both 3.5 and 3.6 (currently 3.6.10)

## What?

This "installer" prepares all the dependencies needed to use PHPUnit with CakePHP 2 through the use of Vendor files instead of relying on Pear.

## Why?

Because I'm a fan of self-contained systems. Sure, installing PHPUnit through PEAR systemwide is "easy". But when you're working on multiple workstations and deploy to different hosting setups its just nice to know you have everything within reach.

## Usage

To install PHPUnit to your CakePHP 2 install you can use the Shell.

`git clone https://github.com/Hyra/PHPUnit-Cake2 app/Plugin/Phpunit`

Run `cake Phpunit.Phpunit install` directly from your console.
This will download and extract all the necessary files, and put them in your specified `Vendor` folder.

Make sure you got `CakePlugin::loadAll()` - or specifically `CakePlugin::load('Phpunit')` in your bootstrap!
Otherwise the plugin will not be available.

You can now use PHPUnit through the CLI or your favourite browser by using the normal `cake testsuite` commands.

It works with Linux and Windows. Please report any problems.

## Autoload

If you have it installed in your ROOT vendors and get some include warnings while baking put this at the top of the VENDORS/PHPUnit/Autoload.php file:

    set_include_path(get_include_path().PATH_SEPARATOR.dirname(dirname(__FILE__)));
    
This way the vendors folder itself is also an include path and those warnings will go away.

## Credits

BIG thanks to Mark Scherer for adding Windows support for the installation shell as well as making selecting version and vendor path dynamic.
The Shell is now 67% more awesome.
